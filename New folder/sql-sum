Calculate the total fees for each course:
sql
Copy code
SELECT course_id, SUM(total_fees) AS course_total_fees
FROM course
GROUP BY course_id;
Calculate the total fees paid by each student:
sql
Copy code
SELECT student_id, SUM(amount_paid) AS total_fees_paid
FROM payment
GROUP BY student_id;
Calculate the percentage of fees paid by each student:
sql
Copy code
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.course_id, c.course_name, 
    p.total_fees_paid, c.course_total_fees, 
    (p.total_fees_paid / c.course_total_fees) * 100 AS percentage_paid
FROM student s
JOIN payment p ON s.student_id = p.student_id
JOIN course c ON p.course_id = c.course_id;
This query will give you the student ID, student name, course ID, course name, total fees paid by the student, total fees for the course, and the percentage of fees paid by the student.

To find specific percentages like 10%, 25%, and 50%, you can modify the above query using the HAVING clause:

For 10%:

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.course_id, c.course_name, 
    p.total_fees_paid, c.course_total_fees, 
    (p.total_fees_paid / c.course_total_fees) * 100 AS percentage_paid
FROM student s
JOIN payment p ON s.student_id = p.student_id
JOIN course c ON p.course_id = c.course_id
HAVING percentage_paid >= 10;
For 25%:

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.course_id, c.course_name, 
    p.total_fees_paid, c.course_total_fees, 
    (p.total_fees_paid / c.course_total_fees) * 100 AS percentage_paid
FROM student s
JOIN payment p ON s.student_id = p.student_id
JOIN course c ON p.course_id = c.course_id
HAVING percentage_paid >= 25;
For 50%:

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.course_id, c.course_name, 
    p.total_fees_paid, c.course_total_fees, 
    (p.total_fees_paid / c.course_total_fees) * 100 AS percentage_paid
FROM student s
JOIN payment p ON s.student_id = p.student_id
JOIN course c ON p.course_id = c.course_id
HAVING percentage_paid >= 50;
In the above queries, replace student, payment, and course with the actual table names in your database.
